## Overview

### What I learned
I already have a strong foundation in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allowed me to further enhance my skills by applying them in a real-world scenario, where I gained practical experience in **responsive design**, **dynamic content generation**, and **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.

This project reinforced my understanding of **layout design** and **styling**, particularly in creating **clean**, **responsive user interfaces with HTML and CSS**. I gained a deeper appreciation for **Flexbox** and **media queries** in ensuring that designs are adaptable across various screen sizes. Additionally, I learned how to structure content effectively and use visual design elements, such as **typography** and **color schemes**, to enhance user experience. Overall, it was a valuable exercise in building responsive, static web components.
