## Overview

### What I learned

While working on this project, I realized the potential of using **CSS custom variables** (also known as CSS custom properties) to make styles more flexible and maintainable. This project gave me a great opportunity to experiment with defining reusable values for colors, fonts, and spacing, which can be applied consistently across the entire webpage.

By defining custom variables in the `:root` selector, I could easily adjust key design elements throughout the project without needing to update every individual style rule. This approach not only simplifies the process of theme management but also makes the code more maintainable and easier to scale.

I plan to implement CSS custom variables in future projects to improve readability, reduce redundancy, and quickly modify visual elements without extensive code changes.
